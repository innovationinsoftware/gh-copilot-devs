# Agent Mode Quiz – Answer Key

1. Optimize this sorting function for speed, then benchmark it on sample data and refine it again if needed — **Agent Mode**
   Requires iteration: generate → benchmark → refine.

2. Generate unit tests for this function using unittest, run them, and fix any failing cases — **Agent Mode**
   Needs an external tool (unittest) and multipass refinement.

3. Write a regex to validate email addresses, test it against sample inputs, and refine it until all pass — **Agent Mode**
   Iteration is required to handle edge cases.

4. Draft a SQL query for this dataset, execute it, and rewrite it to improve performance if it runs slowly — **Agent Mode**
   Requires execution and refinement based on results.

5. Summarize this function with a docstring, then rewrite the docstring to match Google style guidelines — **Edit Mode**
   Single-pass edit is sufficient; no iteration or tools required.

6. Implement error handling for this function, run sample inputs through it, and adjust the handling as needed — **Agent Mode**
   Requires iteration: generate → test → refine.

7. Write a simple CLI argument parser, test it with example commands, and refine it for invalid inputs — **Agent Mode**
   Testing and refinement needed after initial implementation.

8. Check this script with flake8 for style violations, then automatically fix and re-check until clean — **Agent Mode**
   Needs external tool (flake8) and multipass fixes.

9. Generate a JSON schema for this data, validate it with test data, and refine the schema with constraints — **Agent Mode**
   Validation and refinement steps required.

10. Produce a logging solution for this script, run it on sample executions, and improve the log messages — **Agent Mode**
   Requires iteration to improve clarity after execution.
